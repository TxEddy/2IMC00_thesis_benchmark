# 2IMC00_thesis_benchmark

## Info
Master Thesis project in which a new database benchmark is created, this benchmark is created by tables and user queries from Sloan Digital Sky Survey <sup>[1]</sup> (SDSS) Skyserver. By using queries created by users this benchmark will be different from other benchmarks, because other benchmark do not use user queries. Query Column Sets <sup>[2]</sup> (QCS) is used to find attributes which are often used in queries. The attributes in the QCS are used to generate synthetic queries and to find correlations between the tables.
